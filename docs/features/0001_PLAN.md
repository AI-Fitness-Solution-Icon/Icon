# Feature 0001: Reposition Bottom Navigation Bar

## Description
Reposition the bottom navigation bar in the dashboard to match the design requirements. The navigation bar should be floating, have rounded corners on all sides, and not extend to the full width of the screen.

## Files to Modify

### 1. `lib/features/dashboard/widgets/bottom_navigation_bar.dart`
- Change the container structure to make it floating
- Update border radius to round all corners instead of just top corners
- Add horizontal margins to prevent full-width extension
- Add elevation/shadow for floating effect
- Remove the border that makes it look attached

### 2. `lib/features/dashboard/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`
- Modify how the bottom navigation bar is integrated
- Add proper bottom padding to the main content to account for floating navigation
- Ensure the navigation bar doesn't interfere with content scrolling

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Update Bottom Navigation Bar Widget
1. **Container Structure Changes:**
   - Remove `BorderRadius.only()` and use `BorderRadius.circular()` for all corners
   - Add horizontal margins (16-20px on each side)
   - Add elevation with `BoxShadow` for floating effect
   - Remove or modify the border to make it less prominent

2. **Styling Updates:**
   - Update the container decoration to include shadow
   - Ensure proper spacing and padding
   - Maintain the existing icon and text styling

### Phase 2: Update Dashboard Screen Integration
1. **Content Padding:**
   - Add bottom padding to the main content area to prevent overlap
   - Ensure the floating navigation doesn't cover important content

2. **Navigation Bar Positioning:**
   - Keep the navigation bar as `bottomNavigationBar` property
   - Add proper spacing from screen edges

## Design Requirements
- Navigation bar should float above the content (not attached to bottom)
- All corners should be rounded and visible
- Should have margins on left and right sides (not full width)
- Should have a subtle shadow/elevation effect
- Should maintain the existing icon and text functionality
