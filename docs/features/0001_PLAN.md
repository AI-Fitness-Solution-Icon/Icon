# Feature 0001: Forgot Password Implementation

## Description
Implement a complete forgot password flow for the Icon fitness app, allowing users to reset their password via email verification. The feature will include a forgot password screen, email verification screen, and new password setup screen.

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Create:
1. `lib/features/auth/screens/forgot_password_screen.dart` - Initial forgot password screen
2. `lib/features/auth/screens/reset_password_screen.dart` - New password setup screen
3. `lib/features/auth/screens/email_verification_screen.dart` - Email verification screen

### Files to Modify:
1. `lib/navigation/app_router.dart` - Add routes for forgot password flow
2. `lib/navigation/route_names.dart` - Add route constants
3. `lib/features/auth/data/auth_repository.dart` - Already has resetPassword method

### Implementation Details:

#### Phase 1: Data Layer
- AuthRepository already has `resetPassword(String email)` method
- AuthRepository already has `changePassword(String currentPassword, String newPassword)` method
- No additional data layer changes needed

#### Phase 2A: UI Screens
1. **Forgot Password Screen** (`forgot_password_screen.dart`):
   - Email input field with validation
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Navigation to email verification screen
   - Error handling and user feedback

2. **Email Verification Screen** (`email_verification_screen.dart`):
   - Display email sent confirmation
   - Instructions for user
   - Option to resend email
   - Navigation to reset password screen

3. **Reset Password Screen** (`reset_password_screen.dart`):
   - New password input with validation
   - Confirm password input
   - Password strength indicator
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Success feedback and navigation

#### Phase 2B: Navigation
- Add routes to app_router.dart for forgot password flow
- Add route constants to route_names.dart
- Ensure proper navigation flow between screens

### Algorithms:
1. **Password Reset Flow**:
   - User enters email → AuthRepository.resetPassword(email)
   - User receives email → Navigate to email verification screen
   - User clicks link → Navigate to reset password screen
   - User sets new password → AuthRepository.changePassword() or direct update

2. **Email Validation**:
   - Check for valid email format
   - Ensure email is not empty
   - Show appropriate error messages

3. **Password Validation**:
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one lowercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character
   - Password confirmation match

### Error Handling:
- Network errors during email sending
- Invalid email format
- Email not found in system
- Password validation failures
- Password change failures
- User feedback through SnackBars

### UI/UX Requirements:
- Consistent with app's design system
- Loading states for all async operations
- Clear error messages
- Success feedback
- Proper navigation flow
- Accessibility support
