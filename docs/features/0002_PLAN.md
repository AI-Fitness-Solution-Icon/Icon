2. `lib/core/services/text_to_speech_service.dart` - Text-to-speech service
3. `lib/features/ai_coach/screens/voice_interaction_screen.dart` - Enhanced voice interaction UI
4. `lib/features/ai_coach/widgets/voice_visualizer.dart` - Audio visualization widget
5. `lib/features/ai_coach/widgets/voice_controls.dart` - Voice control buttons

### Files to Modify:
1. `lib/features/ai_coach/screens/voice_interaction.dart` - Replace placeholder with full implementation
2. `lib/core/services/voice_service.dart` - Enhance existing service
3. `lib/features/ai_coach/bloc/ai_coach_bloc.dart` - Add voice interaction events
4. `lib/navigation/app_router.dart` - Update voice interaction route
